Working example for generating stim and expected vectors:

 - go to top_cslc_generated/code/systemC

	 cd top_cslc_generated/code/systemC


 - compiling systemC code:the .o file for each module should be created, a main file and also the libunits.a

	 make


 - run the main file and create the vector files

	 main

 - remove generated files
  	 make clean


Comments:
 - the .h and .cpp files for each module and the Makefile can be generated by the CDOM_SystemCGenerator from the csl code
 - the stim.h file is created by the user 
 - the stim module and the DUT must be instantiated in the main file by the user and connected via signals
