Working example to generate vector/vcd files using vector control option vecon or vcd control option vcdon.

All code is generated by CDOM_SystemCGenerator except for full content of stim.h and main.cpp which have to be partly written by the user (the main.cpp and stim.h files in the root of this dir are fully written, so no changes have to be made in order to generate vectors/vcds).


Example:
make
main -vecon "top0_.c0_.b0_,top0_.c1_" -vcdon "top0_.c0_.b0_.a0_"

This should create the vector files for top0_.c0_.b0_ and top0_.c1_ and the vcd file for top0_.c0_.b0_.a0_.


It is also possible to turn on vector/vcd for all instances using:
main -gen_all_vectors 
main -gen_all_vcds 

If the user wants to see the existing instances, this command can be used:
main -show_inst 


For a list of all available options, use:
main -h or main --help


In order to recompile the code, first do a:
make clean
