Test for writing vectors using the SystemCVectorWriter.

In b_cslc_generated/code/systemC/ there is the generated code using cslc 2.csl with additional code (stim.h file to write values for the ports and the instantiations and connections in main.cpp).

To generate vectors:

 1. cd b_cslc_generated/code/systemC/

 2. source COMPILE

 3. a.out

 4. Since module b is connected to the stim, only the vectors for b are written:

    emacs stim_vec_b &
    emacs exp_vec_b &

  5. It is possible to modify the values of the input port (from stim.h) or change the time when the values are captured (from b.h) but please don't check in the changes.
