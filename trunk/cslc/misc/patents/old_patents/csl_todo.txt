 add to field
  csl_register ir; 
  ir.add_isa(isa_name); 
  ir.inst_fmt_name.field_name.connect(signal_name); 
  creates a signal that is connected to the field in ir.inst_fmt_name.field_name
 give register to CL to review
 ISA syntax needs to be updated in example unit
 add set_previous_pipestage to the csl_example_unit set_previous(ps_name, ps_name)
 fix the pipeline chapter 
 fix the processor ring schematics
CL 
 review register: each register now has a table with a list of ALL of the ports that are created automatically and which are optional. check that all ports have been added
 add phase difference to clk gen
 review VC and SD
 add to fifo csl_fifo fn { fn(){ set_dimensions (width, depth);
 review VC and SD
 fix example unit

SP 
 read csl_example_unit
 review signal generator
 review VC and SD
 update the tb doc using the notes from monday
 example unit fix the ISA page

AB
 change the name from csl_example_unit to csl_example
 move some files out of the manuals area to a new area called library 
 csl_library 
 csl_library->production (for fm files)
 csl_library->released   (for pdf files)
 move the following files out of manuals to csl_library
 mbist
 memory controller
 micro engine
 pscqn
