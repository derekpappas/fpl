HOW TO addErr - ( add errors)

-first the error needs to be added to
 src/csl_xml_warn_error/csl_warn_error.xml, so check to see if the
 error already exists, if not add it. REMEBER to set the correct
 category ( generic error types), phase ( component) and type ( exact
 type).

-the 'name' part of the error is the enum for the error

-the 'we' part is :'e' - error
                   'w' - warning

- the 'desc' part of the error is the exact error, the message you
  will see on screen, where @ are the arguments of the error(line
  number, file name)

-read src/csl_xml_warn_error/HOW_TO_libCSLC_Errors.txt to know how to
 create the error library.

REMINDER 1 : the error will be added only after you recreate the
warn_error library and recompile

REMINDER 2 : you need to check in the library
(svn/trunk/build/linux/x86_64/csl_xml_warn_error/libCSLC_Errors.a) or
you will BREAK THE BUILD!!! because it will compile only for you!

REMINDER 3 : you need to check in the
src/csl_xml_warn_error/csl_warn_error.xml or you will (indirectly)
break the build because the next guy/girl that creates the warn_error
library won't have your warnings/errors in his/hers .xml so the build
will FAIL!!!
