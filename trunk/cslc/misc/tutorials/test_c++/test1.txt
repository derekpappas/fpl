Write a c++ program to show inheritance and virtual funtions. 
The program will have a base interface class that will implement 
a shapes basic operations like: getPerimeter, getArea, print, read
The program will read from the keyboard the figures, there can be
any number of figures, use stl vector. Also the program will have 
the possibility to construct more complex representations from
the basic figure types. 
possible figures:
point
line
triangle
rectangle
circle
container ( groups of figures)
add enum with all possible classes in the base class,
imeplement surface, perimeter, print, read in the base class
