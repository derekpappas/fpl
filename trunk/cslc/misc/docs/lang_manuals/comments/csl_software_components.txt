document notes:
- The document's structure is not similar to the rest of the documents (chapters listing in the first page). Add it?
- 1.1.1.1 "The graph visualization library is TBD" - what is TBD
- 1.1.1.1 "The BSS software uses the graph visualization library" - is this a specific library (eg developed by a company or is it internal)?
- Figure 1.1: should OS row contain a listing with respect to the kernel (eg: NT, Linux, XNU) or keep the present distinction based on OS version ?
- 1.1.1.2 "[...]the set of CDOM functions for elaborating and levelization the CDOM and the other CDOM support functions": changed levelization with "levelizing (topologically sort)" from a context below. 
- 1.1.2.1 Replaced "IEEE 1384-(1995,2001) verilog" with "IEEE 1364-(1995,2001) verilog"
- 1.1.3 What does OBDM stand for in the sentence "The OBDM objects are a hierarchical set of classes which are created during the tree walk phase of the front end"
- 1.1.3 Is levelization = topologically sorting ? 
- 1.1.3.2 "The CDOM persistent database saves and restores the CDOM volatile RAM memory state to and from respectively the hard disk drive." - the CDOM persisten databse resides only on hdd drive or it cand also be fitted on other storage devices such as pen drives, floppy disks etc ?
- Figure 1.3: Should this be turned into a table (and update cross references) ? It doesn't appear to require a figure to hold its contents.
- 1.1.5 Added in the bulleted list: "The second column “Description” provides a short description of the tool" (it was missing). In the same bulleted list, I have replaced:
	"The third column “cmd shell“ = command shell development required"
	with
	"The third column “cmd shell“ indicates if command shell development is required"
and the same rephrasing for all occurences of the = sign
- "The tools <formal name> (<command name>) are shown in the “Tool Name” column. the tool will be invoked from the command shell using the<command name>" - I haven't seen any <formal name> (<command name>) in the Tool Name column, only <formal name>.
- Table 1.1: In the Req IP development for gen_clksynch tool there is "other?". should there be anything else added here ?
- Figure 1.4 What is the purpose of the filled box in the background ? Is it supposed to outline a certain class of tools ? It affects the readability.
- 1.1.6.1 What is the gen_i meta language ? Is it specific to gen_i ?
- 1.1.6.1.2 The whole bulleted list reffers to gen_reg ?
- Table 1.2 Register name table does not contain values
- 1.1.6.1.3 Is it gen_spsqn or gen_cpsqn ? I coosed the latter.
- same subchapter in the sentence "The clock domain crossing FIFO will use data synchronizers to pass the grey coded read and write addresses to the other clock domains to be used to generate the full and empty signals" - it is not explained what are the full and empty signals and/or where do they exist.
- Figure 1.7: what are the names of the input signals for the flip-flops
- Figure 1.8: what are the pads, pad_macros, units*, MBIST, IOBIST, BISR, FUSE, mfg_test blocks in this context ? Should their meaning be explained ?
- 1.1.6.1.8 "TBD A bus generator for system on a chip." What does TBD stand for ?
- Figure 1.11 What are unit_sel0, unit_sel1, unit_sel2, req0, grant1 (which repeat 3 times) ?
- 1.1.6.1.10 What are BISR components ?
- 1.1.6.1.13 "gen_fuse creates the fuse block which will configure the personality of the chip" - what is the personality of the chip ? maybe the behaviour ?
- 1.1.6.2.1 "Protocol extractor/checker." - Incomplete ?
- 1.1.6.2.4 does not contain anything
- 1.1.6.2.5 What are these pads and what are they used for ?
- 1.1.6.2.6 does not contain anything
- How is Figure 1.15 related to the contents of 1.1.6.2.7 ? 
- 1.1.6.2.11 Replace: "The RTL floor planner can place the memories on the chip (desirable since memories can consume up to 50% of the chip)." 
with 
	"The RTL floor planner can place the memories on the chip (desirable since memories can occupy up to 50% of the chip area)."
	?
- Figure 1.16 What does it represent ? Especially the top-left block
- 1.1.6.2.13 does not contain anything
- 1.1.6.2.14 In the text there's the sentence "This will build emulation boards" - what are emulation boards and how are they used in this context ? Then, in the sentence "Pin mapping files are generated" - what is the purpose of the pin mapping files in this case ?
- Figure 1.17 What is the tree structure represented there and how is it related to the Simulation Debug Tracer
- Figure 1.18 Why is all the text in the figure underlined ?
- 1.1.10 Is it gen_i or gen_ii ?
 Also, I added the sentence "Then the chip control, FIFO’s, SRAMS, clock domain crossing syncrhonizers, and system on chip buses are generated" to the bulleted list paragraph (it was body)
- 1.1.10.1 what is the signal handler ?
