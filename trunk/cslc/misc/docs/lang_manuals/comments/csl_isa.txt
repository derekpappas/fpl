reffered documents:
.fm file is /docs/manuals/production/csl_files/csl_isa.fm

document notes:
- 1.1 in the bulleted list what does microcode documentation reffer to? what type of documentation does the cslc generate ?
- what is the CSLASM specification ?
- In the sentence "CSL ASM specification will be compiled by the cslc into an assembler and constants from a CSL ISA specifiction." I couldn't understand the "into an assembler and constants" part: the compiler generates assembler, but what are the constants in this case ?
- Figure 1.1 has no contents
- Below Figure 1.1 I have rephrased:

"The usage model in  1.2  CSL ISA Usage Model shows how the assembler and verilog code is created and how the user writes asm code and how it is assembled and how the simulation loads the binary code into the instruction memory and executes the binary."

		to:

"The usage model in 1.2  CSL ISA Usage Model shows how the assembler and verilog code is created, how the user writes asm code which is assembled and how the simulation loads the binary code in the instruction memory and executes the binary."

- Below Figure 1.2 there are:
	 some refferences to opcodes, yet there is no clare explanation what kind of instructions contain opcodes and what does the opcode payload reffer to
	 a code section (C++ class) which appears incomplete
	 after the source code there are some refferences which are incomplete. Maybe need to be expanded ?
- Figure 1.3 has no title
- below Figure 1.3 is a code section that is incomplete
- Below Figure 1.5 is a code section which is incomplete. Should the OM classes be explained ?
- 1.3 Command summary - "datapath_select tuples": add a footnote explaining what a tuple is? Like: "A row in a relational table; synonymous with record, observation." - it was a new word to me.
