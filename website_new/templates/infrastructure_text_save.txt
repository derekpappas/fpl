Designs are becoming so complex that a higher level design
		specification system is required to build the RTL design,
		verification components, functional simulators, and system software
		hooks. 
		
		The Fastpath speciification language is C++ with additional hardware
		extensions. C++ is 
		used to describe a chip design's infrastructure design,
		simulation, and verification components at a high level of abstraction using C++ object oriented classes and
		constructs. The language is simple and intuitive and closely
		parallels existing RTL languages such as Verilog and SystemC at
		the experssion and statement level. 
		<br/>
		Fastpath Logic's C++ specification is designed to raise the level of
		abstraction used to specify and describe a chip design. Fastpath Logic
		provides the end user with a flexible specification system that
		facilitates rapid changes and design exploration. In addition
		the extended C++
		is a single source for the common design, verification, and
		simulation components. Using a single source guarentees
		consistency between the different domains and eliminates parallel
		bookkeeping between the different domains. The C++ specification is compiled by the
		Fastpath Logic synthesis engine which in turn synthesizes the specification
		and generates industry standard RTL (Verilog/VHDL), C++, SystemC,
		and documentation.	The user then adds the control logic and any
		low level implementation details and the combined infrastructure
		and user written logic is then compiled with industry standard
		RTL, C++, and SystemC compilers. 
		<br/>
		Future development will include
		interfaces to popular specification languages such as Denali's RDL
		and SPIRIT EXACT. Fastpath Logic's tool is design to be the
		central management system for chip design projects and interfaces
		seemlessly with existing languages and existing EDA
		tools. Fastpath Logic's synthesis engine can be used in
		ASIC, FPGA, and custom design environments. 
		<br/>
		C++ reduces the amount of work required to develop the infrastructure
		on a chip design project by a factor of 30x-50x. The time to
		learn C++ with a few hardware extensions 
		is short relative to the learning curve required to learn
		other more proprietary solutions. Furthermore, since th
		Fastpath Logic synthesis engine generates output in 
		existing industry standards it easily integrates into
		existing and new design projects.
