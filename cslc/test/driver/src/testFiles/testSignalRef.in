# This is the input test file for CTestSignalRef class
# <> means obligatory
# [] means optional
# {} means group
# *x means this should repeat x times
# Syntax: ( <name> <MODULE_TEST> )
# the module test has to add a signal with the same name as the signalRef for this to work, else assert(0)
# examples:

( test ( n gigi y ( 0 0 1 COmSignalPort ( 1 0 test 0 ) 0 ) 0 0 ) )
#this sould end the program abnormaly:
#( test1 ( n gigi y ( 0 0 1 COmSignalPort ( 1 0 test 0 ) 0 ) 0 0 ) )
