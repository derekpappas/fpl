How the build/regression system can be improved..

General Aspects:

The most important features/improvements of the regression system have to be:
- organizing the testing process based on the "testsuite" concept (totally independent of files, directories and hdls)
- improved reporting format (xml + xslt only)
- more info added to the reports:
  * platform and environment information, 
  * add all valgrind’s tools as optional regress stages
  * categorizing the errors based on stage/level and importance
  * progress history and archiving
- modularization of the entire application (split into files/classes)
- OOP conversion of the code
- integration/usage of external tools (cpan XML parsers like twig xml)
- improved configuration (text/xml config file and command-line/environment parameters)
- GUI for the configuration and results information
