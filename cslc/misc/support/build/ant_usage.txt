ant clean -> cleans the current project/subproject
ant -> build build the project/subproject with no flags 
compile)
ant coverage -> build the project/subproject using coverage flags
ant debug -> build the project/subproject using debugging flags (default(normal))

to all this you can add the following 2 flags:
-q -> the build will be quiet
-v -> the build will be verbose

Examples:
ant clean -v
ant coverage -q
ant debug
etc
