Implement a C++ class design to support the picture
that is presented to you on the whiteboard, and then
instantiate the classes in the needed hierarchy for it.
The design of the C++ classes will look like this:
1) A base class to implement the functionality of a 
   tree. (CBase)
2) The base class constructor is protected and takes
   a EType(enum) that tells what kind of object is 
   instantiated. Also a getType function in the base 
   class.
3) The needed derived classes are:
   CUnit
   CPort
   CWire
   CGate
4) Add a virtual traverse function to simulate the circuit
  (For a given input calculate the output)
4) Restrictions:
  use stl vector for children in the tree
  all function members are private and have get methods,
  You may add setMethods where needed.
