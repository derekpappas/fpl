1.3 CSL Register File Command Summary: missing comments: 
register_file_name.output_reg (register_name), 
register_file_name.event( register_name ),
register_file_name.do_not_connect_registers_fields_to_ios( [ all | <register_field>] ),
register_file_name.connect_input_to_registers_fields( [all|<register_field>] ),
register_file_name.clock( <clock_name> ),
register_file_name.connect_registers_fields_to_outputs( [all|<register_field>] ),
register_file_name.register_fields.explicitly_cleared( [[register name | register address], <signal_name>] ),
<register_file_name>.in_prefix

1.4 CSL Register File Commands: missing comments (explanations)
<register_file_name>.output_reg ( register_name ),
<register_file_name>.valid(),
<register_file_name>.event ( (rd|wr) (register_name | all_regs ) ),
<register_file_name>.event ( register_name ),
<register_file_name>.event( register_name.[field_name] ),
<register_file_name>.out_prefix ( register_name ),
<register_file_name>.out_prefix ( register_name.field ),
<register_file_name>.in_prefix ( prefix, (register_name | all_regs) ),
<register_file_name>.in_prefix (register_name),
<register_file_name>.in_prefix (prefix, (register_name | all_regs)),
<register_file_name>.address_range(<address_range>),

FIX : connect_all_registers_to_inputs -> more explanations needed

Figure  1.25 Register file with a read from an individual register named status// FIX -> is it in the right place ?

<register_file_name>.in_prefix -> needs comments
