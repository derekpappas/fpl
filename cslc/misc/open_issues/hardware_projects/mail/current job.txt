Alex,

Forward this email to Oana B.

1. Mihai will write the ISA for the RISC chapter in the NLP book

2. Take the latest information about the ring processor and update
the ring processor document that OanaB should have checked in yesterday.
Cut and paste the text. Convert ASCII tables into Open Office Write tables.

3. Understand the operation of the ring processor.

4. Talk to CL and divide the CSL/Verilog work between the two of you.

5. Write the ring node (no processor) CSL and Verilog. This should take the
    two of you less than a week to get up and running

6. Get instructions from California first then add the NIOS2 to the Ring 
Node.
The people in California have a stripped down version of the NIOS2 Verilog.

7. Get instructions from California first then ddd the Ethernet MAC

STOP DEVELOPMENT HERE AND ASK WHAT TO DO NEXT.

Power PC, or Flash  is the next phase after you get the ring nodes working
but we need to talk about this..

3. Collect a list of the current jobs and people assigned to each
job  for the HW team and send them to Mr. Haba and I.

Thanks.
