A programming language describes the design hierarchy fora computerchip
design.
The design hierarchy consists of the function unit interfaces, the
design i8nstaces in each unit.and the formal to actual connections
between each unit,.
Each signal connection between two units is updated when the
clockthata conrolsthe driflip flopwhich rivesthe unti is updated.
The group of signals which connects each unit contains values at each
clock edge.
Input ports cause the functional unit to reevaluate onthe controllong
clock ege. 
The resul of the reevaluation appeats on the outputs ports of the
functional unit.
The output values are vaildafter the reset ofthe functional unit and
if requred when a signal(s) os assertted which indicates that the
functional unit is units outputs are valid.
One verification methodology uses an abstract/simpliofied model of the
DUT to model the functional behavior of the design. This model is
simplified in the sene that thte loGic implemented vby can be simplified
and may not be cycle accuraTE
