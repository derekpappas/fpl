- identify the type of test that needs to be written based on the complexity of the test
- is the class just a container
- does the class contain scalars(numerics)
- is the class an algorithm
- control logic

identify the location of the bug (filename/line number)

how do you identify where the bug is

    problem: seg fault
    solution: run gdb, 
	      run valgrind
    problem: missing information
             incomplete objects
             missing data to private variables
             private variables set to wrong values
             control flow problems
             missing functionality
    problem: they don't think in code
	     they can't solve a problem without help
	     they can't use the msdn.com docs for stl
    solution: practice coding with small problems 
                              with algorithms
    problem: they hand write their own code
    solution: give the guys a typing game to play
