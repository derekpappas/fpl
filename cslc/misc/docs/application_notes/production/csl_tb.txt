connecting CSL testbenches to existing Verilog designs

csl_testbench testbench_name;
testbench_name.use_existing_rtl_design(rtl_module_name);

This command specifies that the cslc will connect the testbench to an
existing RTL design (and not to a CSL specified unit).

A csl_vector or thecsl_arch_state specification is created which
specfies the signals and order of the signals to be included in the
vector or architectural state.

The existing RTL design is read into the cslc and the signals in the 
csl_vector or the csl_arch_state specification are compared to the
signal names in the RTL module interface.

Alternatively, the existing RTL design is read into the cslc and the 
user selects the signals or memories in the RTL module interface and 
creates a new csl_vector or the csl_arch_state specification

A csl_vector only contains module/unit ports. A vector only contains 
ports with one direction.
