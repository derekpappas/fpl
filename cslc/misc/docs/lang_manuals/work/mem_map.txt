This goes in the mem map doc
The page size needs to be specified for a virtual memory.
<page_number>_<address>
  000_0..(n-1)
  001_0..(n-1)
  010_0..(n-1)
  011_0..(n-1)
  100_0..(n-1)
  101_0..(n-1)
  110_0..(n-1)
  111_0..(n-1)

Rules for adding one memory map to another memory map

  F H V
F 1 1 1
H 0 1 0
V 0 0 0 

F = flat
H = hierarchical
V = virtual

If the source memory map size exceeds the space ramaining of the page, it is an error!

hierarchical memory map
Unit addresses
1. The unit addresses can be automatically generated which guarentees that the unit 
   addresses are not duplicated.

2. The unit addresses are specfied by the user and the mem map elab unit checks that 
there are no dpulicate addresses. 


Broadcasting -> only in CSLOM (in lib only after interconnect gets implemented in library)
send the same information to all units in the scope based on a broadcast bit.
If the scope_name is the top of the design then all units listen to the broadcast bit

unit_name.set_broadcast(); 

Hierarchical broadcast can be created by setting broadcast on lower level units.

csl_unit top, a,b,d;
top.add_instance(a);
top.add_instance(b);
top.add_instance(c);

top.set_broadcast(); // all units listen to the "top" broadcast bit

a.set_broadcast();  // all units listen to the "a" broadcast bit
b.set_broadcast();  // all units listen to the "b" broadcast bit
c.set_broadcast();  // all units listen to the "c" broadcast bit
