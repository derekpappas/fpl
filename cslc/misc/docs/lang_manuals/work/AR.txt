- shearching for signals in the scope (AR)
 Search for signal in local scope in the current scope portlist, locallist and in actuals in each instance.

if(!connectablelist.empty()) {
  
}
else {
  search in the portlist of the unit that is instantiated
}

if NCA == LHS or NCA == RHS 
  then do

 If signal is found in local scope 



 Else if the signal does not exist





-----------------------------------------------------

Needed functions:


Traverse(T)
traverse(unit_LHS, unit_NCA, LHS_signal_name, RHS_signal_name, )

for each unit in the unit RHS() {// list connect the unit o unit NCA
traverse(unit, unit_NCA)
}
connect(NCA)
Walk traversal print(unit names, signal names, width, direction,type)


//update them when moving to the next scope 
csl_signal currentSignal;
csl_signal nextSignal;
