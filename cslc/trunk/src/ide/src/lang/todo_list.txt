1. we can have an option for set the working directory
   - after the working directory is set, all the files/projects will be saved in that directory.
   - the working directory should be set once, when you exit from the CSLC IDE and start again, the working directory should be the same.

2. we can have a left window inside the CSLC IDE that will be the worksplace
   - in this window is showed the project that is working on and all the libraries.

3. we can have a status bar somewhere in the bottom of CSLC IDE window
   - we can see the status of the project
   - we can see the compilation time

4. we can have another window to see the generated output (verilog code)

5. we can have an option to set an output file where will be saved the output verilog generated code

6. we can have a search option / search and replace option

7. we need a solution to compile more than one file from a project (i.e.: like a compile option)

8. we need an option to break or end the simulation

9. we can add to the help tag a kind of documentation about the csl sintax

10.we can have some pop-up help when you have the mouse cursor over a meniu tag/button more than n seconds  :)

11.we can have a debug option

12.we can have autoindent option

13.maybe tab should be equal with 2 spaces/ blanks

14.IDE has a bug: when you want to exit (press [x]) a window apears to confirm the exit and if you press NO (to revoke the exit action) the IDE will be closed

15.when you press "open" to open a file, the folders that appear in the "open window" are cramped and the names of folders are cutted
